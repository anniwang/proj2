Questions:

For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.
Type your answers directly in this file.


1.  Edit solve.cpp to use the 3x3 Slider Puzzle and the LinkedListDict
for seenStates.  Comment out the usleep call and cout statements.
What is the runtime when you use StdStack for activeStates?
When you use StdQueue for activeStates?  (These will take several minutes.)
Notice that these are MUCH faster than in Project 1, because I have
improved LinkedListDict, but your code will make things run even faster!

- using StdStack and LinkedListDict, running the 3x3 Slider Puzzle is as follows:

- using StdQueue and LinkedListDict, running the 3x3 Slider Puzzle (for a VERY long time) is as follows:

- Summary: even though the stdQueue and stdStack are much faster, it still took a really long time to solve the 3x3 slider puzzle. Also BFS using the stack was much faster than DFS using the Queue.



2.  Now, change the code to use FixedChainHashDict with size 1000.
What are the runtimes, and how many steps long was the solution found,
using StdStack and StdQueue?
You can now see the trade-off of DFS vs. BFS.
And you should see the huge gain of hashing.

- using StdStack and FiedChainHashDict, solving 3x3 Slider Puzzle we get:
>> # steps:
>> runtime:

- using StdQueue and FiedChainHashDict, solving 3x3 Slider Puzzle we get:
>> # steps:
>> runtime:


3.  Repeat Q2 with ResizeChainHashDict.  (What are runtimes and steps, etc.?)
What is the average number of
collision chain nodes examined per call to find?

- using StdStack and ResizeChainHashDict, solving 3x3 Slider Puzzle we get
>> # steps:
>> runtime:
>> # collision chain nodes examined/call:

- using StdQueue and ResizeChainHashDict, rsolving 3x3 Slider Puzzle we get
>> # steps:
>> runtime:
>> # collision chain nodes examined/call:


4.  Now, edit solve.cpp to go back to using LinkedListDict, but switch
to HeapPriorityQueue.  Try running the program with the usleep and
cout commands enabled.  Do you see what BestFS is doing?  (Either yes or
no is fine, but it's fun to try to see what's happening.)  Then,
comment out the usleep and cout statements and time this.  How long
did it take?  You should really see the advantage of BestFS!

- 12m21.962s 
  Not sure what it's doing exactly, but the benefits are obvious!


5.  With your new data structures, the 3x3 slider puzzle has become
too easy!  You can try the 4x4 slider puzzle if you'd like, but then
switch to the 5x5 slider puzzle.  Make sure you are using HeapPriorityQueue.
How long does this take if you use LinkedListDict?  FixedChainHashDict
with size 1000?  ResizeChainHashDict?  Are you impressed?

- runtime with of 5x5 Slider Puzzle with HeapPriorityQueue and LinkedListDict:

- runtime with of 5x5 Slider Puzzle with HeapPriorityQueue and FixedChainHashDict(size=1000):

- runtime with of 5x5 Slider Puzzle with HeapPriorityQueue and ResizeChainHashDict:

We will be checking your implementations of HeapPriorityQueue,
FixedChainHashDict, and ResizeChainHashDict.
